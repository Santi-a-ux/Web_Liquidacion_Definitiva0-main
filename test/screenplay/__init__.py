"""
Screenplay Pattern Implementation for Web Liquidaci√≥n Definitiva

The Screenplay pattern is a user-centered approach to writing automated tests.
It focuses on what actors (users) do to accomplish their goals, rather than
how they interact with the system.

Key Components:
- Actors: Represent users of the system
- Abilities: What actors can do (e.g., browse the web, make API calls)
- Tasks: High-level business goals (e.g., login, create employee)
- Interactions: Low-level actions (e.g., click, fill form)
- Questions: Queries about the state of the system (e.g., is user logged in?)
